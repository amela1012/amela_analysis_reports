# Koro Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing public data from the website [koro.com](https://www.koro.com). The goal is to explore and draw meaningful conclusions from the data, such as trends, patterns, and insights related to the products or other available information.

## Project Overview
I collected data from the website and used Excel and Python for data analysis. I focused on `snacks` section. The conclusions were based on this analysis, and the results are presented in Excel.

### Key Conclusions
- **Trend 1**: Brief explanation of a significant trend.
- **Insight 2**: Explanation of another key insight.
- **Observation 3**: Mention any interesting observations.

## Screenshots
Here are some visuals from the analysis:

1. Screenshot 1: *Description of the screenshot (e.g., a graph showing product price trends)*
2. Screenshot 2: *Another description (e.g., a table highlighting popular product categories)*

## Files Included
- **[Data Analysis Report (Excel)](link-to-excel-file)**: A detailed report of the analysis, including tables, graphs, and summaries.
- **Python Code**: The Python scripts used for data collection, cleaning, and analysis can be found in the `scripts/` folder.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python packages and dependencies needed to run the code.
