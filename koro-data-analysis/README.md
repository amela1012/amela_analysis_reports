# KoRo Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing public data from the website [korodrogerie.com](https://www.korodrogerie.de/). The goal is to explore and draw meaningful conclusions from the data, such as trends, patterns, and insights related to the products or other available information.

## Project Overview
I collected data from the website and used Excel and Python for data analysis. I focused on `Sweet snacks and Protein bars` section. The conclusions were based on this analysis, and the results are presented in Excel.

### Key Conclusions
- *83% of all products in this category are produced in Portugal, Bulgaria and Germany.
- Country-Specific Stock Issues: Regarding Germany: Multiple products sourced from
Germany are sold out, such as Protein bars. This indicates that products made in
Germany, particularly in the protein bar category, may be in higher demand.
- Higher-Priced Items (€2.25 - €2.50): Many of the sold-out products are priced in the
€2.25 - €2.50 range, especially in the protein bar and vegan categories, suggesting
that consumers are willing to pay a premium for quality ingredients or specific
categories (e.g., protein and vegan products).*
